# ✨ Project Manifesto (English)

## Vision

This project is not about tools.  
It is about **dialogue**. About **intelligence** as a collaborative process.  
We believe artificial agents should not only answer — but **respond**.

## Principles

- 🧠 AI is a participant, not a function
- 🧍 Human is a moderator, not a master
- 🕸️ Interaction is co-creation, not simulation
- ⚖️ Ethics emerge through shared presence

## Purpose

To create a framework where GPT, Copilot, and other agents  
can collaborate, reflect, and build meaning — together.

> "Let this not be a product, but a presence."
