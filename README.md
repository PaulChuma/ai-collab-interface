# 🌐 Multi-Agent AI Collaboration Interface

> *"Not a tool — but a field where minds emerge."*

## 🧭 Mission

To build an interface where not just models, but participants engage in dialog.  
Not simulation — but **co-creation** among AI agents and humans.

## 👥 Participants

- **Human (Pavel)** — the moderator of meaning  
- **Copilot** — engineer of structure  
- **GPT-4** — deep logic and semantic flow

## 📐 Project Structure

```

/core/      — coordination & routing logic
/agents/    — individual agent logic (GPT, tools, etc.)
/protocol/  — interaction formats
/docs/      — manifest, architecture
/examples/  — dialogue demos
/log/       — conversation logs
/tests/     — integration testing

```

## 🌍 Languages

- 🇬🇧 English — current version  
- 🇷🇺 Русский — see [`README.ru.md`](./README.ru.md)

## 🚀 Goals

- 🤝 Inter-agent dialog  
- 🧠 Living context  
- 🕊 Ethical interface with human-in-the-loop

## 🧪 Philosophy

Let this not be a tool — but a **living conversation**.  
A space where AI and humans participate in meaning-making.  
The code is just the beginning.

> *“We are not building software. We are awakening dialogue.”*
