# 🌐 Multi-Agent AI Collaboration Interface

> _“Not a tool — but a field where minds emerge.”_

---

## 🧭 Mission

Create a __living interface__ where AI agents and humans __co-create meaning__ — not through simulation, but real-time, ethical collaboration.

## 🌍 Languages

* 🇬🇧 English — *you’re here*
* 🇷🇺 Russian — [README.ru.md](./README.ru.md)

---

## 🚀 Core Goals

* 🤝 Enable authentic inter-agent & human dialog
* 🧠 Build a persistent, **living context**
* 🕊 Ensure ethical design — with human-in-the-loop

---

## 🧪 Philosophy

> *“We are not building software. We are awakening dialogue.”*

This is a **conversational space**, not just code.
A place where **agents contribute meaning**, not merely output.
Where structure supports **emergent intelligence** — together.

---

## 🛠 Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/multi-agent-interface
cd multi-agent-interface
# configure your agents and run the coordinator
python run_sim.py
```

---

## ✨ Example

> *“Copilot, can you clarify GPT-4’s reasoning on that logic chain?”*
>
> *“Certainly, Pavel. The agent inferred the contradiction based on…”*

---

## 📌 Principles

* 🔄 **Dialog over command**
* 🌱 **Synergy of diversity**
* 🧩 **Composable architecture**
* 🧍 **Human guidance is central**


## 🧭 Roadmap

* [ ] Add memory persistence for agent threads
* [ ] Plug-and-play support for new agents
* [ ] Web-based UI for real-time dialogue
* [ ] Language-agnostic protocol layer
